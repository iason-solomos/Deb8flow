# deb8flow: Multi-Agent Debate Simulation with LangGraph

**deb8flow** is a full-stack, multi-agent AI debate framework built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). It simulates a structured and fact-checked formal debate between two autonomous AI agents ‚Äî one PRO and one CON ‚Äî orchestrated by a moderator and finalized with a judge's verdict.

This project showcases complex agentic flows, runtime control logic, fact verification, and dynamic decision-making in a fully controlled LangGraph workflow. If you're exploring how to build serious multi-agent systems with memory, routing, retries, and arbitration, **deb8flow** is your guide.

## Features

- **Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate Flow**  
  PRO vs CON debaters exchange structured arguments, rebuttals, counters, and final remarks.

- **LLM-Powered Agents**  
  Built using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.1 (with web search) and LangChain runtimes.

- **Fact Checker Agent**  
  Validates claims using OpenAI's integrated web search; enforces accuracy with retry logic and disqualification if falsehoods persist.

- **Moderator & Router Nodes**  
  Uses `Command` objects to orchestrate debate flow and enforce stage transitions.

- **Judge Agent**  
  Concludes the debate with a verdict based on clarity, structure, and persuasive merit.

- **Fully Modular LangGraph Architecture**  
  Clean separation of nodes: topic generator, debaters, fact checker, routers, and judge.

## Flow

## Debate Flow Overview

- **Topic Generator**: Produces a nuanced, debatable topic for the session.

---

### Opening Phase
- **Pro Agent**: Delivers the **opening statement** in support of the topic.
- **Moderator**: Passes the floor to the **Con Agent**.
- **Con Agent**: Responds with a **rebuttal** to the Pro‚Äôs opening statement.

---

### Counter Phase
- **Moderator**: Returns the floor to the **Pro Agent**.
- **Pro Agent**: Offers a **counterargument** to the Con Agent's rebuttal.

---

### Closing Phase
- **Moderator**: Passes the floor to the **Con Agent** again.
- **Con Agent**: Presents their **final closing statement**.
- **Moderator**: Wraps up and hands off to the **Judge Agent**.

---

## Fact-Checker Agent Rules

- After **every speaker**, the Fact Checker **evaluates each claim** for accuracy.
- If a statement **fails the fact-check**, the speaker must **restate** or **correct** their argument.
- Any debater who fails **three fact-checks** automatically **loses** the debate.

---

## Judging Criteria

- The **Judge Agent** reviews the full debate history and evaluates both sides based on:
  - Argument **quality**
  - Logical **clarity**
  - Structural **coherence**
- The most persuasive, well-reasoned side **wins**.
